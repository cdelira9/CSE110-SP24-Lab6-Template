1. The approach I would take to fit my automated tests in my Recipe project development pipleine would be integrating theses tests within a GitHub action. Not only does this align with the CI/CD pipeline methods as discussed in class but it provides immediate feedback where developers can address issues and bugs early. Manually runnint tests locally introduces human error in the tests while actions allow for a more consistent automation of the testing process and more efficient as the project grows.
2. No, end-to-end testing is meant to stimulate real user scenarios whereas unit testing would be a better option if the correct output is returned.
